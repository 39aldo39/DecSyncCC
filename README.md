DecSync CC is an android application which synchronizes contacts and calendars using [DecSync](https://github.com/39aldo39/DecSync). To start synchronizing, all you have to do is synchronize the directory `DecSync` located in the primary external storage, using for example [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net).

The UI is based on the one used in [DAVdroid](https://davdroid.com).
