Privacy Policy
==============

DecSync CC only stores data strictly necessary for the app to function. The enabled contacts/calendars/tasks are stored in the corresponding Android content providers, which makes them available for other apps with the appropriate permissions. Furthermore, the enabled contacts/calendars/tasks are also synchronized with the selected DecSync directory, which makes them also available for other apps with access to this directory. Other than this synchronization, DecSync CC does not upload any data and does not contain any tracking or ads.

Permissions
-----------
- Contacts: Used to manage the contacts stored by DecSync CC.
- Calendars: Used to manage the calendars stored by DecSync CC.
